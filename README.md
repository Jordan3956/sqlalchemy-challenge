# sqlalchemy-challenge
In this project I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of my climate database(Hawaii). Specifically, I use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib to extract data from the following iresources, hawaii.sqlite, hawaii_measurements.csv, hawaii_stations.csv. I used these tools to preform a precipitation analysis and a station analysis and provided graphs for both in the file titled climate.ipynb. Next I created 
a climate app which flask API based on the queries that I just developed.





Note for grader* All together this was a challenging project especially the app. I'm not sure I got the app exactly right so I'm very excited to see the feedback because I went back and forth on some of the code thank you.
